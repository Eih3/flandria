# Flandria

Flandria is a fansite for the Fantasy MMORPG Florensia.

### Stack

Flandria uses Flask as backend and the build-in render engine Jinja2.
Jquery and Boostrap is also used.

### Installation

Python requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to run.

Install all required python modules:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Todos

 - TESTS! (Really, I fucking need tests)

### Development

If you want to contribute, you can copy the databases from ```flandria/demo/``` in the root directory. The databases include all items, however, no drops and obviously no user data. :)
Feel free to create pull requests.
